    <p> Dear <span class="pcolor">Ricky</span>, 
        <br> Thank you for being my Valentine once again... 
        <br> and THANK YOU FOR BEING YOU!! 
        <br> Not a single day goes by were I don't think of you. I know we spend a lot of time together.
         <br> But I truly wouldn't have it any other way.
          <br> <span class="pcolor">YOU are my best friend. You are my lover. You are my life.</span>
           <br> I promise to cherish you for as long as I have you.. and I hope that is for a long long looooooong time. 
           <br> I hope you enjoyed this teeny tiny website I made for you. 
           <br> Whenever you need a reminder for my love for you, I hope you come here and remember. 
           <br> <span class="pcolor"> With all of the love, <br>your girlfriend Camila. </span>
